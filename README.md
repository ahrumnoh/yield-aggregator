# Defi Yield Aggregator - Practice

This project is a simple decentrialized app where a user can deposit DAI into our smart contract.
Once funds are deposited, the contract compares the interest rate of Compound & Aave, and deposits
funds to whichever has the highest interest rate. The user can rebalance his/her funds to ensure
that the funds are still currently in the higher interest rate protocol, and can also withdraw at any time.
